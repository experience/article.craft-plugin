# Article Craft Plugin #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/experience/article.craft-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/experience/article.craft-plugin)

Matrix is an incredibly powerful way of building "article" pages, comprised of different content blocks; text, quotes, images, code, and so forth.

Markdown is perfect for writing textual content quickly and intuitively, without getting lost in WYSIWONT hell.

Matrix and Markdown must be a match made in heaven, right? Not quite.

When you're authoring the content, it all works splendidly. When it comes time to render everything on the page, it all becomes rather tricky. Accidentally included a bit of whitespace in your template, in just the wrong place? Well done, your entire article is now a code block. Working with footnotes? Splendid, chances are you've now got footnotes at the bottom of each Matrix block, rather than at the end of the article.

It's possible, but it's painful. Fear not, Article is here to relieve your suffering.

Just tell Article where to find your content block templates, and it will take care of the rest. Footnotes, Markdown whitespace, the lot.
